#ABSENT is a flag used to specify whether you are using a database where you know a target microbe is present or not. Default is no.
#if flag is set to "yes", then you need to specify a NCBI's taxonomy ID for the taxon that is kept constant using TIPERMAMENT flag
#TIPERMANENT=568206
#TOTALGENOMES is a flag that you need to specify if ROC CURVE analysis flag is on. its mean the universe of genomes (data base) that you used in mapping step (all genomes)
#ABUNDANCE specify how many reads mapped or should map to the database. This flag will convert raw read counts to proportions
